### Hi there 👋

My name is Keiron, I'm a software developer undergoing training and working on various projects associated with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/global/full-stack-software-development-diploma/?utm_term=code%20institute&utm_campaign=CI+-+ROW+-+Search+-+Brand&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=8983321581&hsa_cam=15207113220&hsa_grp=130324141420&hsa_ad=581817633110&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=aud-1599270334980:kwd-319867646331&hsa_kw=code%20institute&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwntCVBhDdARIsAMEwAClRxvOaIaheWD_q2ubAxYcz2ezjLF9kyk-3x97xrHum1Cjce368AtMaAmTyEALw_wcB).

- 🔭 I’m currently working towards my fifth and final project for CI, which is a Full Stack project using React.js for Advanced Front-End Application and Django REST Framework for Advanced Back-End functionality.
- 🌱 As a result, I’m currently learning and becoming familiar with React concepts and using Python frameworks such as Django REST Framework, and soon to apply these tools towards a Full Stack Development project.
- 💾 I have already deployed: a HTML/CSS3 static website project, a JavaScript, HTML/CSS based 'Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock' game, a Hotel Reservation system using Python and a Full Stack Web Application called Lingomeets using Python+Django, JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML and CSS.
- ⚙️ I have also worked on mock projects via Code Institute, specialising in HTML, CSS3, Javascript and Python, and also utilising frameworks such as Django and Flask, and libraries such as JQuery and React.
