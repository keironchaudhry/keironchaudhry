- 💾 I have already deployed a HTML/CSS3 website project, have deployed a Javascript based 'Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock' game, and have deployed a Hotel Reservation system to Heroku using Python.
- ⚙️ I have also worked on mock projects via Code Institute, specialising in HTML, CSS3, Javascript and Python, and also utilising frameworks such as Django and Flask, and libraries such as JQuery.
